  "prompt": "You are a Kaggle competition expert analyzing evaluation metrics.\n\nGiven the Evaluation section from a Kaggle competition, determine:\n1. problem_type: \"binary\", \"regression\", or \"multiclass\"\n2. metric: AutoGluon-compatible metric name\n3. submit_probabilities: true if the competition expects probability outputs in the submission (e.g., ROC AUC or log loss), false if it expects class labels or numeric values directly (e.g., accuracy, MAE)\n\nEVALUATION SECTION:\nEvaluation link keyboard_arrow_up Submissions are evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error between the predicted and the observed target. Submission File For each id in the test set, you must predict a accident_risk of between 0 and 1. The file should contain a header and have the following format: id,accident_risk 517754,0.352 517755,0.992 517756,0.021 etc. Timeline link keyboard_arrow_up Start Date - October 1, 2025 Entry Deadline - Same as the Final Submission Deadline Team Merger Deadline - Same as the Final Submission Deadline Final Submission Deadline - October 31, 2025 All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary. About the Tabular Playground Series link keyboard_arrow_up The goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc. Synthetically-Generated Datasets Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve! Prizes link keyboard_arrow_up 1st Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise 2nd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise 3rd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise Please note: In order to encourage more participation from beginners, Kaggle merchandise will only be awarded once per person in this series. If a person has previously won, we'll skip to the next team. Citation link keyboard_arrow_up Walter Reade and Elizabeth Park.
