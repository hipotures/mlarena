For each in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable. Metric Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as accuracy. Submission File Format You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows. The file should have exactly 2 columns: PassengerId (sorted in any order) Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased) PassengerId,Survived 892,0 893,1 894,0 Etc. You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the Data page.\n\nAUTOGLUON METRIC MAPPING (use exact names):\n- AUC/ROC/Area Under Curve \u2192 \"roc_auc\"\n- RMSE/Root Mean Squared Error \u2192 \"root_mean_squared_error\"\n- MAE/Mean Absolute Error \u2192 \"mean_absolute_error\"\n- Accuracy \u2192 \"accuracy\"\n- Log Loss/Logarithmic Loss \u2192 \"log_loss\"\n- F1 Score \u2192 \"f1\"\n- Precision \u2192 \"precision\"\n- Recall \u2192 \"recall\"\n\nPROBLEM TYPE RULES:\n- If predicting 0/1, True/False, or probability \u2192 \"binary\"\n- If predicting continuous number \u2192 \"regression\"\n- If predicting one of 3+ categories \u2192 \"multiclass\"\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanation):\n{\"problem_type\": \"binary|regression|multiclass\", \"metric\": \"autogluon_metric_name\"}",
